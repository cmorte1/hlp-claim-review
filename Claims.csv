When we looked in the attic, we found what looks to be a very wet decayed mouse at that spot.;2023-06-29T15:48:45.304000;water damage;;Wall above the basement door and the attic space;FALSE;The claim description indicates potential water damage through a hole in the wall above the basement door and that the basement door no longer closes, but it lacks a definitive source of water. Additionally, while a very wet decayed mouse was found in the attic, it does not explicitly clarify whether this is related to the water damage or suggests a separate issue. Therefore, without identifying how the water entered or confirming the extent of further damages, such as impact on personal property or additional structural issues, it is insufficient to proceed with the claim at this point.;;;;;;

However, it lacks critical information regarding the source of the water that caused this damage, which is essential for validating a water damage claim. The decisions uniformly highlight this missing element, with emphasis on the importance of identifying the source of water intrusion to substantiate claims. For a water damage claim to be adequate, it should clearly articulate how the water manifested—such as through leaks, flooding, or other means—and specifically what was damaged. In this case, the vague indication of mold and moisture does not suffice to meet the necessary claim requirements.;;;;;;

To make the claim valid, it is essential to know whether the flooding was due to an external factor such as heavy rain, a plumbing failure, or another cause. Furthermore, the description does not clarify the extent of the damage within the basement and garage, such as what specific items or structures were affected. Without this detailed context, including the nature of the source of the water and the scope of damages, the claim cannot proceed.;;;;;;

This satisfies the criteria for a valid claim by clearly identifying both the source of water (the storm) and the affected area (the driveway). The specificity in detailing the storm's intensity and its impact on the driveway corroborates the claim's validity, providing sufficient reasoning to proceed with the claim.;Homeowners-3-Special-Form_HO0003_201105.pdf;Homeowners-3-Special-Form_HO0003_201105.pdf - page 9, Homeowners-3-Special-Form_HO0003_201105.pdf - page 12;;0;This claim is Excluded under Section I – Exclusions, A.3.a and A.3.c, of the Homeowners Special Form HO 00 03 05 11.

None of the listed exclusions applies to rainwater entering through a roof leak. The Water exclusion (Section I – Exclusions A.3, page 3) addresses flood, surface water, sewer backup and seepage through below-grade openings—not precipitation leaking through a roof. While Wear and Tear (Section I – Exclusions C.(6)(a), page 10) excludes deterioration-related losses, there is no indication the leak resulted from aging or poor maintenance. In the absence of any named exclusion, the sudden intrusion of heavy rain through the roof is insured under the open-peril language of Coverages A and B.;TRUE

However, it fails to specify the later consequences of this incident, such as what was damaged—whether it be personal property, flooring, or structural components. Without this critical information detailing the extent and nature of the damage resulting from the incident, the description does not provide enough clarity to proceed with the claim.

It identifies the source of water as the plumbing system and specifies the damaged area as the basement, which meets the standard requirements for sufficient details needed to evaluate the claim. The involvement of a restoration company recommending to file a claim further supports the severity and legitimacy of the reported issue, indicating it warrants action. Therefore, the information is adequate to proceed with the claim.;Homeowners-3-Special-Form_HO0003_201105.pdf;Homeowners-3-Special-Form_HO0003_201105.pdf - page 10;Coverage A;370193;This claim is Covered under Coverage A – Dwelling up to the policy limit.
